# iwtsms - i want to see my skin

a 1.7.10 coremod that disables certain mods rendering things on the player model so you can see your skin

current supported mods:
- adventure backpack
- galacticraft
- traveller's gear

only tested with gtnh, might not work with non-gtnh versions of those mods

if you want to disable vanilla armor rendering, use cosmetic armor reworked, its better
